# SweetShell 2.0

I came after from a C++ internship. Now the code I wrote before is like a disater! With everything I've learned, I announced that SweetShell is being refactored to its 2.0 version.

## 2.0 Features

-   Cross-platform support
-   Modern C++20 style
-   Industrial-level design
-   Everything is self-implemented, totally from scratch (except the standard library though!)
